The tidy dataset summarizes the data by giving the average of each measurement for a particular
activity conducted by the study participant.


# Definitions
+ Acc - Acceleration
+ Gyro - Rotation
+ Mag - Magnitude
+ std - Standard Deviation
+ XYZ - represents the 3-dimensions of the possible movement/measurement.
+ Jerk - Jerk signals

The variables in this dataset are separated into three to four sections. 

# Example 1

tBodyAcc_mean_of_means_X - Mean of the mean acceleration of the body on the x-axis of the phone measured in time

+ t - stands for time
+ BodyAcc - acceleration of the body
+ mean_of_means - average of the mean
+ X - X-axis of the phone

# Example 2
fBodyGyroJerkMag_mean_of_std - Mean of the standard deviation of the magnitude of the rotation jerk measured by frequency.

+ f - frequency
+ BodyGyro - Rotation of the body
+ mean_of_std - average of the standard deviation
