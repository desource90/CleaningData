The tidy dataset summarizes the data by giving the average of each measurement for a particular
activity conducted by the study participant.


# Definitions
+ Acc - Acceleration
+ Gyro - Rotation
+ Mag - Magnitude
+ std - Standard Deviation
+ XYZ - represents the 3-dimensions of the possible movement/measurement.
+ Jerk - Jerk signals

The variable names in this dataset are separated into three to four sections. The casing of the variable names from the original dataset are preserved for the purposes of being easier to read. The underscores are included for the same reason.

# Example 1

tBodyAcc_mean_of_means_X - Mean of the mean acceleration of the body on the x-axis of the phone measured in time

+ t - stands for time
+ BodyAcc - acceleration of the body
+ mean_of_means - average of the mean
+ X - X-axis of the phone

# Example 2
fBodyGyroJerkMag_mean_of_std - Mean of the standard deviation of the magnitude of the rotation jerk measured by frequency.

+ f - frequency
+ BodyGyro - Rotation of the body
+ JerkMag - Magnitude of the jerk signal
+ mean_of_std - average of the standard deviation
